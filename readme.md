## Frequently Asked Questions

### Why was this plugin created?

This plugin was created to provide a more secure option for restricting coupon usage. The default email usage restriction for coupons in WooCommerce is based on the unverified billing email address field, which can be freely set by users. By using role restrictions, you can ensure that only verified and authorized users in specific roles can use certain coupons, making it a secure option.

My personal motivation was to have 100% discount coupons that could be used only be staff or developers, without the possibility of this being exploited by somebody putting a fake staff email into the billing email address field.

### How do I restrict a coupon to specific roles?

Edit the coupon and go to the "Usage restriction" tab. In the "Roles" section, select the roles allowed to use the coupon. If you want to exclude specific roles, select them in the "Excluded roles" section.

### What happens if a role is both allowed and excluded?

If a role is both allowed and excluded, the exclusion will take precedence, and users with that role will not be able to use the coupon.

### Can I use this plugin with other WooCommerce coupon restrictions?

Yes, this plugin works alongside other WooCommerce coupon restrictions such as minimum spend, maximum spend, and product restrictions.
